> ⚠️ Revy, as well as this template, are highly experimental and NOT production ready. 

This template includes:

- Revy
- Pesde *(Package management)*
    - Revy *(ECS tookit)*
- Rokit *(Toolchain manager)*
    - Rojo
    - Darklua
- Selene (Linter)

# Prerequisites

- [Rojo](https://rojo.space)
    - Make sure you [update your plugin](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/13916111004/Rojo)?
- [Rokit](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rokit)
    - Authenticated using `rokit login`
- [Pesde](https://docs.pesde.dev/installation/)
    - Authenticated using `pesde login`

I'd suggest installing both tools first and then restarting your system!

# Setup

1. Run setup script

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh`
```

2. Specify `roblox` as the environment when asked.
